# Config options
## Quota
Configure how fast a `new quota` takes to rack up, including instantly if desired.

## Seed Number
*(Does not effect the vanilla seed text shown at the start of a quota)*

Show the map seed number during gameplay.  Configure the font size and color, and select from a list of presets for the position or enter your own custom position.  The default configuration places it at the bottom left corner in a subtle manner so that it isn't too distracting during gameplay.
