# Config options
## Quota

Configure how fast a `New Profit Quota` takes to rack up, including instantly if desired.

## Seed Number

*(Does not affect the vanilla seed text shown at the start of a quota)*

Show the map seed number during gameplay.  Configure the font size and color, and select from a list of presets for the position or enter your own custom position.  The default configuration places it at the bottom left corner in a subtle manner so that it isn't too distracting during gameplay.

## Fixes
At the moment, this only has one fix, which is to fix the player's rotation when exiting the facility through a fire exit.

## Fixes - Fire Exit Player Rotations
This config section is dynamically generated as you discover each fire exit, so it may not even get created until you go through your first fire exit, and will continue to grow as you go through more.  You can tweak the angle of the player's rotation for each fire exit that has been added to this list.

## Helpers
At the moment, this only has one helper, which attempts to help GeneralImprovements' lightning warnings to work with custom hotbar sizes.  Without this, GeneralImprovements' lightning warning feature may not work beyond the vanilla 4 item slots provided by some mods.  This option will have no effect if you don't have GeneralImprovements installed.
