# Config options
## Quota
Configure how fast a `new quota` takes to rack up, including instantly if desired.

## Seed Number
Enable/Disable the map seed number display, configure the font size and font color, and select from a list of presets for the position or enter your own custom position.  The default configuration places it at the bottom left corner in a subtle manner so that it isn't too distracting during gameplay.
